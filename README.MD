lob.li - Objective Link Shortener
==================================
    - This is a link shortener, more structured and refined from the UnPS shortener (found https://github.com/UPSolutions/unps.us-Shortener)
    - With more focus towards stability and ease of use. 

Core code will be based off of Short version 4-2.9 and versions will be determined as follows:

    - First period: Major release version
    - Second Period: Minor release version
    - Third Period: Current Stable version
    - Fourth Period: Current Testing version
    - Fifth Period: Current Dev version
    - Sixth Period: Current commit version (incremented every commit by 1)

    - So if the version is 1.5.3.6.2.20, it should be read as:
        - Version 1.5 Third Stable release - live at http://lob.li
        - Version 1.5.3 Sixth Testing (Beta) release - live at http://dev.lob.li
        - Version 1.5.3.6 Second Developing (Unstable or broken) release - Not live
        - Number of commits since last developing version

This project will consist of three branches:
    - unstable
    - beta
    - stable (master)

Please only run the stable or beta in live environments, unstable might have bugs or might not even work at all
